# NeuroSonix: AI-Driven Acoustic Modeling for Precision Transcranial Ultrasound

This project is focused on enhancing the precision and effectiveness of transcranial ultrasound therapy using AI-driven acoustic modeling. By simulating the interaction between ultrasound waves and brain tissues, I aim to improve treatment targeting for conditions like neurological disorders and brain tumors. This project explores the use of appropriate CNN architectures to optimize the focus and intensity of therapeutic ultrasound waves while minimizing off-target effects.

## Features
- **AI-based Acoustic Modeling**: Utilizes deep learning models to simulate ultrasound propagation through complex brain structures.
- **Wave Optimization**: Adjusts focus and intensity to ensure precision in targeting specific brain regions for non-invasive treatments.
- **Data-Driven**: Integrates MRI/CT scans to customize simulations based on individual patient anatomy.
- **Therapeutic Application**: Potential applications in treating neurological disorders (e.g., Parkinson’s, Alzheimer’s) and targeting brain tumors.
